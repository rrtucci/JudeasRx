# JudeasRx FAQ

1. **I type a probability into one of the probability boxes and the 
   corresponding slider doesn't move. Is this a bug?**

    Press enter at the end of the probability box and the slider will move.
2. **A slider doesn't move. Is this a bug?** 

   Sliders with a red 
label are disabled and can't be moved. Sliders with a green label are enabled.
3. **Can you explain the notation for experimental and observational 
   probabilities?**

   The notation is explained in the chapters entitled "Personalized Treated 
   Effects" and "Personalized Expected Utility" of my free open source book 
   "Bayesuvius"
   [https://github.com/rrtucci/Bayesuvius](https://github.com/rrtucci/Bayesuvius)
4. **Can you explain how you use PyMC3?**

   JudeasRx uses PyMC3 in its class PyMC3_model_builder. That class uses 
   PyMC3 
   exactly as 
   described in the [this thread](https://discourse.pymc.io/t/bayes-nets-belief-networks-and-pymc/5150) 
   of the PymC Discourse.
