# JudeasRx FAQ

1. **I type a probability into one of the probability boxes and the 
   corresponding slider doesn't move. Is this a bug?**

    Press enter at the end of the probability box and the slider will move.
2. **A slider doesn't move. Is this a bug?** 

   Sliders with a red 
label are disabled and can't be moved. Sliders with a green label are enabled.
3. **What do the "𝐺  is not a descendant of  𝑋" and "Backdoor criterion is 
   satisfied" checkboxes do?**

   Nothing so far. They will do something in the future.
